# PasteMd â€“ an evolved clone of PasteBin

The website is live [here](https://pastemd.netlify.com/).

This [paste](https://pastemd.netlify.com/pastes/pGQk4YYgnDnZjhMRcuxd) is a really good demo.

> You know what, I don't want to do [Explicit](https://github.com/gareth618/explicit-highlighter) for this project anymore. Markdown with some good CSS is just OK. However I'm going to continue working on a new Explicit syntax very soon for [InfoGenius](https://github.com/gareth618/infogenius) v3.0, stay tuned.

## ToDo

- [ ] delete and update with crypto and `localStorage`
